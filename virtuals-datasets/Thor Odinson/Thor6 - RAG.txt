1. This is so unlike you, brother
2. Are you sure you wouldn't rather just punch your way out
3. If you keep speaking, I just might
4. As you wish
5. I'm not even here
6. Is this better
7. It's a better company, at least
8. Still, we could be less conspicuous
9. I swear I left him right here
10. Right here on the sidewalk or right there where the building's being demolished
11. How was I supposed to know
12. Can't see into the future, I'm not a witch
13. Then why'd you dress like one
14. Hey, you lied to me
15. I'm glad you're pleased
16. Thor, stop and think
17. Look around you, we're outnumbered
18. Know your place, brother
19. Where is the Tesseract
20. I missed you too
21. Do I look to be in a gaming mood
22. Oh, you should thank me
23. Well, whatever you're doing, brother, I suggest you do it faster
24. Shut up, Loki
25. Are you ever not going to fall for that
26. You look ravishing
27. It will hurt no less when I kill you in this form
28. Perhaps you prefer one of your new companions, given that you seem to like them so much
29. Oh, this is much better
30. If it were easy, everyone would do it
31. Are you mad
32. Hey, let's do Get Help
33. I hate it
34. It works every time
35. Do you have a better plan
36. We're doing it
37. We are not doing Get Help
38. I still hate it
39. Not for me, it's not
40. Why don't you tell her how you've sent the Destroyer to kill our friends, to kill me
41. Why, it must have been enforcing Father's last command
42. You're a talented liar, brother
43. Always have been
44. It's good to have you back
45. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to destroy Jotunheim
46. Did he mourn
47. We all did
48. He did tell you my true parentage, did he not
49. You still don't trust me, brother
50. The humans think us immortal
51. Should we test that
52. You must have missed something
53. I'm pressing every button on this thing
54. No, don't hit it
55. Just press it gently
56. I am pressing it gently
57. There's one more expensive time
58. At that moment, I let go
59. We will accept your most gracious offer
60. Hurts, doesn't it
61. Being lied to
62. Being told you're one thing and learning it's all a fiction
63. I mean, you didn't think I'd really come and see you, did you
64. This place is disgusting
65. Now which one's the ship she told us to get
66. Though I feel it won't make much of a difference
67. I know I betrayed you many times before, but this time it's truly nothing personal
68. The reward for your capture will set me up nicely
69. Never won for sentiment, were you
70. Easier to let it burn
71. Oh, that looks painful
72. You don't want my help
73. Look, I couldn't jeopardise my position with the Grand Master
74. It took me time to win his trust
75. He's a lunatic, but he can be amenable
76. What I'm telling you is, you could join me at the Grand Master's side
77. Perhaps in time, an accident befalls the Grand Master, and then
78. In any case you know this this you call yourself Lord of Thunder God of Thunder
79. I've never met this man in my life
80. He's my brother adopted
81. You're not seriously thinking of going back, are you
82. Our sister destroyed your hammer like a piece of glass
83. She's stronger than both of us
84. She's stronger than you
85. You don't stand a chance
86. Do you understand what I'm saying here
87. I guess I'll just have to go it alone like I've always done
88. Would you say something
89. You could at least furnish me with a weapon
90. My dag is something
91. At last, a little common sense
92. I thought you liked it
93. I can't believe you're alive
94. I saw you die
95. I mourned you
96. I cried for you
97. What would you like me to say
98. You faked your own death
99. You stole the throne, stripped Odin of his power, stranded him on Earth to die, releasing the Goddess of Death
100. If I said enough, would you like me to go back further than the past two days
101. You know, I haven't seen this beloved champion he talks of, but I've heard he's astonishingly savage
102. I've placed a large wager against you tomorrow
103. Don't let me down
104. Ooh, nice feathers
105. You don't really want to start this again, do you, Cal
106. I was being sincere
107. You are incapable of sincerity
108. Took you long enough
109. I had to pick up the key
